intermission.py - minqlx-plugin that triggers a sound at each game end
- add intermission to your server.cfg minqlx plugins
- use cvar: qlx_intermissionSound "soundpath" to set

Tip: If you want a custom sound/music other than those included in the base paks, you can add a custom workshop item with the sound. It needs to be in mono OGG or WAV format and the pak structure is /sound/customsoundfolder/sound.ogg (or wav).
See: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=539821860 for info on uploading your custom pak to the workshop.
Once that's up you can add: qlx_intermissionSound "soundpath" (same format as pak) to your server cfg and you are good to go!

Enjoy! :D - roasticle (roast on quakenet IRC)
